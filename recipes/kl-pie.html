    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>If you are making your own graham cracker crust:</strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor for 15-20 seconds until
          it resembles coarse crumbs.
          <br />
          Pour into a separate bowl and add the melted butter. Mix until it
          becomes sandy, then press into a pie plate or 8-inch round pan (no
          need to grease it).
          <br />
          Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before filling.
        </p>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a medium-size bowl, using a handheld or stand mixer, beat together
        the cream of coconut (or sweetened condensed coconut milk) and key lime
        juice on medium/low speed until combined. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate large bowl, using a handheld or stand mixer, beat together
        the dairy-free Cool Whip and dairy-free cream cheese on medium/low speed
        until smooth. Then, pour the cream of coconut/lime juice mixture into
        the cream cheese & cool whip mixture and beat on medium/low speed until
        all ingredients are smooth and fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the filling into the graham cracker crust. Please note you may have
        some extra filling so be mindful when pouring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the top back on (or cover with foil) and freeze for at least 8
        hours, or for best results, overnight. When ready to serve, remove from
        the freezer and slice into pieces. Pie should be able to be cut quite
        easily, but will melt fast. Return to freezer when not eating.
      </li>
    </ol>
